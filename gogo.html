                <p>GoGo is a revamp of the SLO Safe Ride mobile app that I and a team of 6 others developed during CalPoly Hacks 2017. We placed third out of fifteen teams at the Hackathon. It was sponsored by companies such as General Electric, Amazon, Google, etc. SLO Safe Ride offers students, tourists, and local residents a safe transportation option in the city. Our goal of the Hackathon was to combat drunk driving, and we decided to do so by making GoGo as user friendly as possible.</p>

                <p>We created a quick ride button that allowed the user to request a ride without having to login into an account in case they were too intoxicated to put all that information in. We also implemented a credit card scanner that would allow the user to simply take a picture of their credit card, instead of manually typing the numbers in.</p>

                <p>In order to increase the usage of GoGo against other competitors, we included a rewards system into the application. SLO Safe Ride is teamed up with many of the bars and restaurants downtown, and offer special discounts for using their rides. However, not many students or residents are aware of this, so we wanted the app to bring more attention to this.</p>
