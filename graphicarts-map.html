                <p>Because of the confusing architecture of the graphic arts building at the university I attend, when people walk into an entrance they aren’t sure if they are on the first or second floor. 
                The original maps had a confusing layout and were outdated. I redesigned the building maps to provide a clearer understanding of the building layout and  reflect the organizations listed in the building and their location. I also designed additional signs to be hung from certain entrances to provide additional guidance on where to go.  </p>
                

                <p>The presentation of my design process is shown to the right. I followed a design-research process of defining the problem, researching, performing competitive analysis, and forming a solution. I presented my design process to the head of the department before beginning the detailed map design. I wanted to have the approval of my overall plan before concentrating on the design details. After his approval, I mocked up a final design and was able to print and mount each of the four maps. They now hang in my university's graphic arts building. </p>
